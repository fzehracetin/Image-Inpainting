# Image Inpainting

In this project I will be using 4 inpainting methods on MIT Places Dataset. 3 inpainting methods are based on neural networks. On the other hand, 1 method based on statistics.

##### Neural Methods
1. [Generative Inpainting (2018)](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting)
2. [Partial Convolutions (2018)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv)
3. [High-Resolution Neural Inpainting (2017)](https://github.com/leehomyc/Faster-High-Res-Neural-Inpainting)
##### Statistical Method
4. [Statistics of Patch Offsets (2012)](https://github.com/Pranshu258/Image_Completion)
